 abstract = {Context. The mass and radius of a planet directly provide its bulk density, which can be interpreted in terms of its overall composition. Any measure of the radial mass distribution provides a first step in constraining the interior structure. The fluid Love number k2 provides such a measure, and estimates of k2 for extrasolar planets are expected to be available in the coming years thanks to improved observational facilities and the ever-extending temporal baseline of extrasolar planet observations.},
