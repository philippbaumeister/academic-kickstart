abstract: "One of the main goals in exoplanetary science is the interior characterization of observed exoplanets. A common approach to characterize a known exoplanet is the use of numerical models to compute interior structures complying with the measured mass and radius of the planet. With only these two observables, possible solutions tend to be highly degenerate, with multiple interior compositions that can match the observations equally well. We explore the application of mixture density neural networks to the interior characterization of exoplanets. Using a 1D interior structure code, we construct a large training set of sub-Neptunian exoplanets. A model planet consists of an iron-rich core, a silicate mantle, a water ice layer, and an H/He envelope, all constrained by prescribed mass fractions. Using a mixture density network trained on a large dataset of such modelled planets, we show to what extent the distribution of possible model solutions can be predicted from just mass and radius."
